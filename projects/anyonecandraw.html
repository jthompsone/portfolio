                <h1>Anyone Can Draw app</h1>
                <p>UI/UX Design</p>
                <h2>The Idea:</h2>
                <p>
                    The Anyone Can Draw app would be a vector-based drawing app
                    somewhat similar to Adobe Illustrator. You can draw with
                    something like the Pen Tool, or free hand it and refine it
                    after it's drawn. The app would work on most
                    smartphones/tablets, and even other touchscreen devices like
                    Chromebooks! You can either use your fingers or a stylus to
                    draw, so long as it's compatible with your device. The app
                    would also have tutorials/guides on how to get started
                    drawing, and there would also be tooltips for when using the
                    app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I'm trying to solve with my app is people's fear of
                    learning something new, specifically drawing in this case.
                    It can be hard to start something new, especially without
                    help. That's this app aims to do, guide people on how to
                    start drawing and show them the process behind it, so they
                    can feel comfortable doing it on their own later on.
                </p>
                <h2>Developing Personas:</h2>
                <h3>Proto-Personas</h3>
                <p>
                    Before getting to design proper personas by doing user
                    interviews, I developed proto-personas by trying to get in
                    the mindset of three unique users who would be interested in
                    using my app.

                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>
                    I put out a user survey to find good applicants who would
                    make the basis of my actual personas. After getting 21
                    responses to my survey, I then narrowed down my portential
                    candidate users to 7, and reached out again to them to get 3
                    declines, and 4 who agreed; I would have the 4th person be a
                    backup in case any of the first three couldn't do the
                    interview anymore. I would then interview the 3 final
                    candidate users using a user interview script, and record
                    each candidate's responses in a text document, which I then
                    used to develope fully fleshedout personas, but with
                    personal details removed from the actual user.

                <h2>Empathy Maps</h2>
                <p>
                    From the newly created personas, I would then move ahead to
                    create empathy maps for each persona.

                    to triad, then I tried two monochromatic styles, and a I did
                    one split complementary.
